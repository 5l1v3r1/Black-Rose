## What is Remote Access Trojan (RAT)

A Remote Access Trojan (RAT, sometimes called Creepware) is a type of malware that controls a system through a remote network connection. A RAT is typically installed without the victim's knowledge, often as payload of a Trojan horse, and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from security software and other anti-virus software

### Unicast addressing

Uses a one-to-one association between a sender and destination: each destination address uniquely identifies a single receiver endpoint.

### Multicast addressing

uses a one-to-many-of-many or many-to-many-of-many association, datagrams are routed simultaneously in a single transmission to many recipients.

uses a one-to-all association, a single datagram from one sender is routed to all of the possibly multiple endpoints associated with the broadcast address.

3. The blackrose database must be built before it is executed. (**Ex: create database blackrose;**)
4. If the database has a password, you must enter it in line 843.
5. It is not necessary to remind you that the MySQL database must be installed.
6. For **Windows** operating systems, libraries **MySQLdb and PyHook** must be **installed**.
